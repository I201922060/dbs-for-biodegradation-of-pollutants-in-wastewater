The mibPOPdb database is a manually curated integrative resource dedicated to microbial bioremediation of persistent organic pollutants (POP) research. 
Data are systematically and manually collected from the scientific literature.

The following datasets are provided: 

1. Genes: This Zip folder contains data concerning POP metabolizing microbial strains identified to possess the functional genes associated with the POP biodegradation processes collected from the scientific literature and public databases.

2. Strains: This Zip Folder file contains data extracted from works of literature concerning algal, archaeal, bacterial, and fungal microbial strains that have been identified based on culture-dependent and â€“independent approaches to possess POP catabolic activities.

3. Sequences: This compressed ZIP folder file contains nucleotide and protein sequences of the POP degrading microbial strains collected in this database.

4. Compound: This XML file contains data dedicated to the information on persistent organic pollutants currently listed by the Stockholm Convention.

5. Calculated properties 01: Datasets used to optimize and test the biodegradation prediction tool.
