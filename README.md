# dbs-for-biodegradation-of-pollutants-in-wastewater
Establishment of research-specific databases for analyzing the microbial biodegradation of environmental pollutants.
This study explored approaches to establish manually curated data resources for investigating the microbial degradation of pollutants in wastewater.
The proposed establishment of wastewater-related pollutant-specific degradation databases would facilitate access to specific data and useful information by researchers studying the removal of xenobiotic contaminants in WWTPs systems.
