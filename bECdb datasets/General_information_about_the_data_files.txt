The bECdb database is a manually curated integrative resource dedicated to microbial bioremediation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) research. 
Data are systematically and manually collected from the scientific literature. 

The following datasets are provided: 


1. Biodegradation datasets - PPCPs microbial biodegradation datasets extracted from scientific literature.

2. Emerging Contaminants - A list of commonly used pharmaceuticals and personal care products.

3. Microorganisms - Microbes identified from culture-dependent and â€“independent approaches that can biodegrade PPCPs.

4. Pathway - Biodegradation pathways associated with PPCPs microbial degradation extracted from scientific literature.

5. Proteins- Biodegradative enzymes associated with PPCPs degradation processes

6. Transformation Products - Intermediary metabolites and end-products of the PPCPS breakdown processes.

7. Sequences: This compressed ZIP folder file contains nucleotide and protein sequences of the POP degrading microbial strains collected in this database.
